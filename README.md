# OATS -Study Project Fall 2017
OATS (Opensource Automated Troubleshooting System) is a system that was developed in fall 2017 during a HSR Rapperswil study project.
Its aim is to provide an automated way to perfom classic troubleshooting in a networking environment, something that is mostly still done manually in most companies.
Knowing that most of the stuff we were trying to do was already available in different opensource software, we aimed to identify such tools and combine them in a logical way.
